# ScanFC: Statistical framework for Clustering with Alignment and Network inference of Fold Changes
A Python library containing tools for inference of temporal fold changes from the data, as well as for their subsequent clustering with alignment. For details on the underlying methodology refer to [[1]](#1). To obtain the results on real and simulated data presented in the paper, run file ```scanfc_clustering_example.ipynb``` and files in the 'Simulations' folder respectively.

To install the package run the following in Terminal:
```python
pip install scanfc@git+https://github.com/parsenteva/scanofc@main
```
