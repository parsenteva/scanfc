# Simulation files:

- ### simulation_examples.ipynb
A Jupyter notebook containing examples from simulation studies showcasing frequently observed patterns and some of the potential interesting outcomes.

- ### simulation_functions.py
A python script with the main simulation functions used in both simulation studies..

- ### simulation_study_1.py
Main script of the first series of simulation studies focusing on the choice of distance and clustering algorithm.

- ### simulation_study_2.py
Main script of the second series of simulation studies focusing on the effect of alignment. This script includes the comparis with spectral clustering and the dynamic time warping.

- ### simulation_study_2_FDA.R
An R script used to analyse simulated data from study 2 with a functional data analysis approach.

- ### sim_means.csv
Simulated data, exported from the python script simulation_study_2.py, used in the R script simulation_study_2_FDA.R.
